Depending on the prodived arguments different kind of homotopies are constructed. In particular it is possible to construct the following homotopies:\n\nTotal degree homotopy\nPolyhedral homotopy\nParameter homotopy\nMulti-homogenous homotopy\nStart target homotopy\n\nIf the input is a homogenous polynomial system, solutions in projective space are computed. Otherwise affine solutions are computed.\n\nOptions\n\nThe solve routines takes many different options. In particular all options to CoreTracker and PathTracker are allowed. Additionally the following options are allowed:\n\naffine_tracking::Bool=true: Indicate whether path tracking should happen in affine space.\nearly_stop_cb: Here it is possible to provide a function (or any callable struct) which accepts a PathResult r as input and returns a Bool. If early_stop_cb(r) is true then no further paths are tracked and the computation is finished. This is only called for successfull paths unless save_all_paths is true. This is for example useful if you only want to compute one solution of a polynomial system. For this early_stop_cb = _ -> true would be sufficient.\nhomotopy::AbstractHomotopy: A constructor to construct a AbstractHomotopy for the totaldegree and start target homotopy. The default is StraightLineHomotopy. The constructor is called with homotopy(start, target) where start and target are homogeneous AbstractSystems.\nhomvar::Union{Int,MultivariatePolynomials.AbstractVariable}: This considers the homogeneous system F as an affine system which was homogenized by homvar. If F is an AbstractSystem homvar is the index (i.e. Int) of the homogenization variable. If F is an AbstractVariables (e.g. created by @polyvar x) homvar is the actual variable used in the system F.\npath_jumping_check::Bool=true: Enable a check whether one of the paths jumped to another one.\npath_result_details=:default: The amount of information computed in each path result. Possible values are :minimal (minimal details), :default (default) and :extensive.\nprojective_tracking::Bool=false: Indicate whether path tracking should happen in projective space. The flag affine_tracking is dominant.\nseed: The random seed used during the computations. The seed is also reported in the result. For a given random seed the result is always identical.\nshow_progress (default true): Whether a progress bar should be printed to report the progress of the current computation.\nsystem::AbstractSystem: A constructor to assemble a AbstractSystem. The default is SPSystem. This constructor is only applied to the input of solve. The constructor is called with system(polynomials, variables) where polynomials is a vector of MultivariatePolynomials.AbstractPolynomials and variables determines the variable ordering. If you experience significant compilation times, consider to change system to FPSystem.\nthreading (default true): Enable or disable multi-threading. The number of threads used is controlled by the environment variable JULIA_NUM_THREADS.\nvariable_ordering: Provide a custom ordering of the variables.\n\nExamples\n\nTotal Degree Homotopy\n\nsolve(F; options...)\n\nSolve the system F using a start system computed from the degrees of the entries of F.

The number of paths to track is equal to the mixed volume of the Newton Polytopes of the entries of F. The mixed volume is at most the total degree of F. F can be\n\nVector{<:MultivariatePolynomials.AbstractPolynomial} (e.g. constructed by @polyvar)\nA composition of polynomial systems constructed by compose. Note that the composition will not preserved.\n\nIf only_torus == true then only solutions in the algebraic torus (ℂsetminus 0)^n will be computed.\n\nWe can solve the system F(xy) = (x^2+y^2+1 2x+3y-1) in the following way:\n\njulia> @polyvar x y;\njulia> solve([x^2+y^2+1, 2x+3y-1]; start_system = :polyhedral)\nResult with 2 solutions\n==================================\n• 2 non-singular solutions (0 real)\n• 0 singular solutions (0 real)\n• 2 paths tracked\n• random seed: 222880\n\nParameter Homotopy\n\nsolve(F, startsolutions;\n    parameters,\n    start_parameters,\n    target_parameters,\n    start_gamma = nothing,\n    target_gamma = nothing,\n)\n\nSolve the parameter homotopy\n\nH(x t) = F(x (tγ₁p₁+(1-t)γ₀p₀)  (tγ₁+(1-t)γ₀))\n\nwhere p₁ (=start_parameters) and p₀ (=target_parameters) are vectors of parameter values for F and γ₁ (=start_gamma) and γ₀ (=target_gamma)     are complex numbers. If start_parameters or target_parameters is nothing, it is assumed that γ₁ and γ₀ are 1. The input parameters specifies the variables of F which should be considered as parameters. Necessarily we have length(parameters) == length(p₁) == length(p₀).\n\nsolve(F, startsolutions; parameters, p₁, p₀, γ₁=nothing, γ₀=nothing)\n\nThis is a unicode variant where γ₁=start_parameters, γ₀=target_parameters,     γ₁=start_gamma, γ₀=target_gamma.\n\nWe want to solve a parameter homotopy H(xt) = F(x t1 0+(1-t)2 4) where\n\nF(x a) = (x₁^2-a₁ x₁x₂-a₁+a₂)\n\nand let's say we are only intersted in tracking of 11.

Note that H has to be a homotopy between homogeneous polynomial systems. If it should be considered as an affine system indicate which is the index of the homogenization variable, e.g. solve(H, startsolutions, homvar=3) if the third variable is the homogenization variable.\n\nHomogeneous Systems\n\nIf F has is homogeneous, we return results in projective space\n\njulia> @polyvar x y z;\njulia> solve([x^2+y^2+z^2, 2x+3y-z])\nResult{PVector{Complex{Float64},1}} with 2 solutions\n====================================================\n• 2 non-singular solutions (0 real)\n• 0 singular solutions (0 real)\n• 2 paths tracked\n• random seed: 490575\n\nIf your polynomial system is already homogeneous, but you would like to consider it as an affine system you can do\n\n@polyvar x y z\nsolve([x^2+y^2+z^2, 2x+3y-z], homvar=z)\n\nThis yields the same result as solve([x^2+y^2+1, 2x+3y-1]).\n\nMulti-homogeneous Systems\n\nBy exploiting the multi-homogenous structure of a polynomial system it is possible to decrease the number of paths necessary to track.\n\n@polyvar x y\n# Use variable groups to only track 2 paths instead of 4\nsolve([x*y - 6, x^2 - 5], variable_groups=[(x,), (y,)])\n\nTo check whether a certain variable grouping is beneficial you can use the bezout_number function.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"solving/#Result-1","page":"Solving general systems","title":"Result","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"solving/#","page":"Solving general systems","title":"Solving general systems","text":"A call to solve returns a Result:","category":"page"},{"location":"solving/#","page":"Solving general systems","title":"Solving general systems","text":"Result\nseed","category":"page"},{"location":"solving/#HomotopyContinuation.Result","page":"Solving general systems","title":"HomotopyContinuation.Result","text":"Result{V<:AbstractVector}\n\nThe result of solve.

The endgame  is the name for special algorithms the end of the path tracking. These enable to detect if a path is diverging or if it ends in a singular solution. The PathTracker is more opinionated than the CoreTracker and implements additional logic to handle numerical difficult solutions. In particular it always reparameterizes a solution path to use a logarithmic time scale, i.e., x(t)  x(e^-s) and we track for s from 0 to .\n\nIn order to construct a PathTracker it is recommended to use the pathtracker and pathtracker_startsolutions helper functions. With a PathTracker constructed you can track a single path using the track method. The result of this will be a PathResult.\n\nThe PathTracker assumes that the provided homotopy H is defined in such a way that H(x,1) is the start system and H(x,0) the target system. During the path tracking an approximation of the valuation of a Puiseux series expansion of the solution is computed. This is used to decide whether a path is diverging. Before a certain treshold (s_always_consider_valuation) this approximation is only trusted if a path gives some sign of ill-conditioning. To compute singular solutions the Cauchy endgame is used which is based on Cauchy's integral formula. For this we have to track solutions along a loop around the origin. The number of loops necessary to arrive back at the start point is called the winding number.\n\nOptions\n\nThe path tracker accepts all options which CoreTracker accepts. Furthermore the following options are accepted:\n\nat_infinity_check: This is true if the provided start system is an affine polynomial system.\nendgame_start (default 2.0): The value of s where the endgame is started earliest.\nmax_winding_number (default 12): The maximal winding number tried in the Cauchy endgame.\nmin_accuracy (default 1e-5): The PathTracker automatically lowers the desired accuracy automatically to min_accuracy if path tracking would fail othwerwise (since the desired cannot be reached)\nmin_cond_eg (default 1e5): The minimal condition number before the Cauchy endgame is started or a path is cut off.\nmin_step_size_before_eg (default exp2(-40)): The minimal allowed step size before the endgame starts.\nmin_step_size_eg (default exp2(-120)): The minimal allowed step size during the endgame. This is also control what is considered ∞ for the path tracking.\ns_always_consider_valuation (default -log(1e-16)) A threshold after which we always consider the valuation.\nsamples_per_loop (default8`): The number of samples used during the endgame.\nprecision_strategy (default :adaptive_finite): This controls whether H(x,t) is possibly evaluated with higher than machine precision during the endgame (the Jacobian is always computed with machine precision). The :adaptive_finite allows this only if we are optimistic that we can still obtain a finite solution. Other options are :adaptive_never where this is never allowed and :adaptive_always where it is always enabled. ``\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"path_tracker/#","page":"PathTracker","title":"PathTracker","text":"The easiest way to construct a PathTracker:","category":"page"},{"location":"path_tracker/#","page":"PathTracker","title":"PathTracker","text":"pathtracker_startsolutions\npathtracker","category":"page"},{"location":"path_tracker/#HomotopyContinuation.pathtracker_startsolutions","page":"PathTracker","title":"HomotopyContinuation.pathtracker_startsolutions","text":"pathtracker_startsolutions(args...; kwargs...)\n\nConstruct a PathTracker and start solutions in the same way solve does it.

Its job is to track an initial solution x₁ from t₁ to t₀ by following a solution path x(t). For this a predictor-corrector scheme is used. See our introduction guide for a high-level explanation of the predictor corrector scheme. The CoreTracker accepts for a value t a solution x^* if x(t) - x^*  τ where τ is controlled by the accuracy option.\n\nTo interact with a CoreTracker take a look at track resp. track!. You can also use CoreTracker as an iterator. For this you need to call init!(::CoreTracker, x₁, t₁, t₀) first. There is also iterator if you are only interested in pairs (x,t).\n\nThe CoreTracker cannot handle singular solutions or divergent paths. For this you have to use a PathTracker (which uses internally again a CoreTracker).\n\nThe CoreTracker can track solutions in projective space if the underlying homotopy is homogenous and the provided start solution is a projective vector (with type PVector) from the ProjectiveVectors.jl package.\n\nThe CoreTracker can also perform a reparamterization of the parameter t from 01 towards 0 by t = e^-s. If the homotopy assumes t  01 this can be done by passing the log_transform = true option. If you already have a homotopy which assumes s  0 you can use the logarithmic_time_scale = true to tell the core tracker this. In this case the min_step_size criterion is still applied to t and not s.\n\nOptions\n\nCoreTracker accepts many different options. Here are the options in alphabetic order:\n\naccuracy (default 1e-7): The maximal acceptable distance to the true solution at a time step t.\nauto_scaling (default true): Enables an automatic scaling of the variables by introducing a weighted norm. See also WeightedNorm.\ninitial_step_size: The size of the first step. By default an automatic estimate is computed but this can be overwritten with this option.\nmax_cond (default 1e10): The maximal condition number before a path is terminated due to ill-conditioning. This is only applicable if terminate_ill_conditioned is true.\nmax_corrector_iters (default2`): The maximal number of Newton iteration steps until which the desired accuracy has to be achieved.\nmax_step_size (default Inf): Limit the path tracker to a maximal step size.\nmax_steps (default 1000): The maximal number of steps the path tracker makes. Note that this changes to 10_000 for parameter homotopies.\nmin_step_size (default 1e-14): The path tracking is terminated if the step size is smaller than this value.\nnorm (default InfNorm()): The norm used in the computations. Note that if the auto_scaling is true, this will automatically be converted to a WeightedNorm.\npatch: It is possible to perform tracking in projective space. For the actual compuations we still need to choose an affine chart. There are multiple charts possible, see AbstractAffinePatch. The default is RandomPatch.\nprecision (default :double): This controls the precision used in the computation of H(xt). If it is set to :double only double precision arithmetic is used (Complex{Float64}).  If it set to :double_double double double arithmetic as implemented by the DoubleFloats package is always used. The option :adaptive changes adaptively the precision.\npredictor (default Pade21): The predictor used.\nsimple_step_size_alg (default false): By default the step size algorithm presented in arXiv:1902.02968 is used. If this option is true a more simple step size algorithm is used which doubles the step size after 5 consecutive successive steps and halfes the step size after a failed step.\nterminate_ill_conditioned (default true): Indicates whether the path tracking should be terminated for ill-conditioned paths.
