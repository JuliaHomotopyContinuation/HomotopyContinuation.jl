Its job is to track an initial solution x₁ from t₁ to t₀ by following a solution path x(t). For this a predictor-corrector scheme is used. See our introduction guide for a high-level explanation of the predictor corrector scheme. The CoreTracker accepts for a value t a solution x^* if x(t) - x^*  τ where τ is controlled by the accuracy option.\n\nTo interact with a CoreTracker take a look at track resp. track!. You can also use CoreTracker as an iterator. For this you need to call init!(::CoreTracker, x₁, t₁, t₀) first. There is also iterator if you are only interested in pairs (x,t).\n\nThe CoreTracker cannot handle singular solutions or divergent paths. For this you have to use a PathTracker (which uses internally again a CoreTracker).\n\nThe CoreTracker can track solutions in projective space if the underlying homotopy is homogeneous and the provided start solution is a projective vector (with type PVector) from the ProjectiveVectors.jl package.\n\nThe CoreTracker can also perform a reparamterization of the parameter t from 01 towards 0 by t = e^-s. If the homotopy assumes t  01 this can be done by passing the log_transform = true option. If you already have a homotopy which assumes s  0 you can use the logarithmic_time_scale = true to tell the core tracker this. In this case the min_step_size criterion is still applied to t and not s.\n\nOptions\n\nCoreTracker accepts many different options. Here are the options in alphabetic order:\n\naccuracy (default 1e-7): The maximal acceptable distance to the true solution at a time step t.\nauto_scaling (default true): Enables an automatic scaling of the variables by introducing a weighted norm. See also WeightedNorm.\ninitial_step_size: The size of the first step. By default an automatic estimate is computed but this can be overwritten with this option.\nmax_cond (default 1e10): The maximal condition number before a path is terminated due to ill-conditioning. This is only applicable if terminate_ill_conditioned is true.\nmax_corrector_iters (default2`): The maximal number of Newton iteration steps until which the desired accuracy has to be achieved.\nmax_step_size (default Inf): Limit the path tracker to a maximal step size.\nmax_steps (default 1000): The maximal number of steps the path tracker makes. Note that this changes to 10_000 for parameter homotopies.\nmin_step_size (default 1e-14): The path tracking is terminated if the step size is smaller than this value.\nnorm (default InfNorm()): The norm used in the computations. Note that if the auto_scaling is true, this will automatically be converted to a WeightedNorm.\npatch: It is possible to perform tracking in projective space. For the actual compuations we still need to choose an affine chart. There are multiple charts possible, see AbstractAffinePatch. The default is RandomPatch.\nprecision (default :double): This controls the precision used in the computation of H(xt). If it is set to :double only double precision arithmetic is used (Complex{Float64}).  If it set to :double_double double double arithmetic as implemented by the DoubleFloats package is always used. The option :adaptive changes adaptively the precision.\npredictor (default Pade21): The predictor used.\nsimple_step_size_alg (default false): By default the step size algorithm presented in arXiv:1902.02968 is used. If this option is true a more simple step size algorithm is used which doubles the step size after 5 consecutive successive steps and halfes the step size after a failed step.\nterminate_ill_conditioned (default true): Indicates whether the path tracking should be terminated for ill-conditioned paths. A path is considered ill-conditioned if the desirable accuracy is no more achievable or if the condition number of the Jacobian is larger than 1e14.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"core_tracker/#","page":"Core Tracker","title":"Core Tracker","text":"The easiest way to construct a CoreTracker is to use coretracker and coretracker_startsolutions.","category":"page"},{"location":"core_tracker/#","page":"Core Tracker","title":"Core Tracker","text":"coretracker_startsolutions\ncoretracker","category":"page"},{"location":"core_tracker/#HomotopyContinuation.coretracker_startsolutions","page":"Core Tracker","title":"HomotopyContinuation.coretracker_startsolutions","text":"coretracker_startsolutions(args...; kwargs...)\n\nConstruct a CoreTracker and startsolutions in the same way solve does it.

The endgame  is the name for special algorithms the end of the path tracking. These enable to detect if a path is diverging or if it ends in a singular solution. The PathTracker is more opinionated than the CoreTracker and implements additional logic to handle numerical difficult solutions. In particular it always reparametrizes a solution path to use a logarithmic time scale, i.e., x(t)  x(e^-s) and we track for s from 0 to .\n\nIn order to construct a PathTracker it is recommended to use the pathtracker and pathtracker_startsolutions helper functions. With a PathTracker constructed you can track a single path using the track method. The result of this will be a PathResult.\n\nThe PathTracker assumes that the provided homotopy H is defined in such a way that H(x,1) is the start system and H(x,0) the target system. During the path tracking an approximation of the valuation of a Puiseux series expansion of the solution is computed. This is used to decide whether a path is diverging. Before a certain treshold (s_always_consider_valuation) this approximation is only trusted if a path gives some sign of ill-conditioning. To compute singular solutions the Cauchy endgame is used which is based on Cauchy's integral formula. For this we have to track solutions along a loop around the origin. The number of loops necessary to arrive back at the start point is called the winding number.\n\nOptions\n\nThe path tracker accepts all options which CoreTracker accepts. Furthermore the following options are accepted:\n\nat_infinity_check: This is true if the provided start system is an affine polynomial system.\nendgame_start (default 2.0): The value of s where the endgame is started earliest.\nmax_winding_number (default 12): The maximal winding number tried in the Cauchy endgame.\nmin_accuracy (default 1e-5): The PathTracker automatically lowers the desired accuracy automatically to min_accuracy if path tracking would fail othwerwise (since the desired cannot be reached)\nmin_cond_eg (default 1e5): The minimal condition number before the Cauchy endgame is started or a path is cut off.\nmin_step_size_before_eg (default exp2(-40)): The minimal allowed step size before the endgame starts.\nmin_step_size_eg (default exp2(-120)): The minimal allowed step size during the endgame. This is also control what is considered ∞ for the path tracking.\ns_always_consider_valuation (default -log(1e-16)) A threshold after which we always consider the valuation.\nsamples_per_loop (default8`): The number of samples used during the endgame.\nprecision_strategy (default :adaptive_finite): This controls whether H(x,t) is possibly evaluated with higher than machine precision during the endgame (the Jacobian is always computed with machine precision). The :adaptive_finite allows this only if we are optimistic that we can still obtain a finite solution. Other options are :adaptive_never where this is never allowed and :adaptive_always where it is always enabled. ``\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"path_tracker/#","page":"Path Tracker","title":"Path Tracker","text":"The easiest way to construct a PathTracker:","category":"page"},{"location":"path_tracker/#","page":"Path Tracker","title":"Path Tracker","text":"pathtracker_startsolutions\npathtracker","category":"page"},{"location":"path_tracker/#HomotopyContinuation.pathtracker_startsolutions","page":"Path Tracker","title":"HomotopyContinuation.pathtracker_startsolutions","text":"pathtracker_startsolutions(args...; kwargs...)\n\nConstruct a PathTracker and start solutions in the same way solve does it.
