An affine patch is a hyperplane defined by ``vâ‹…x-1=0``.

This holds the actual patch information.

Construct the state of the path from `x`.

Scale a vector `x` such that it is on the affine patch.

    setup!(::AbstractAffinePatchState, x::AbstractVector)

Setup the affine patch depending on `x` and modify `x` if necessary.
This is only called once at the beginning of a tracked path.

The same as [`setup!`](@ref) but only called during the path tracking.
