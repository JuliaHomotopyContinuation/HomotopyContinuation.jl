# Homotopies

A homotopy is a function
```math
H: \mathbb{C}^N × \mathbb{C} → \mathbb{C}^n, (x,t) ↦ H(x,t)
```
where ``H(⋅, t)`` is a polynomial system for all ``t∈\mathbb{C}``.

## Default homotopies
The following homotopies are available by default
```@docs
StraightLineHomotopy
FixedPointHomotopy
ParameterHomotopy
CoefficientHomotopy
```

We also provide more specialised homotopies, which are mostly used internally currently
but could be useful in conjunction with the [`CoreTracker`](@ref) primitive.
```@docs
PatchedHomotopy
```

## Interface for custom homotopies

The great thing is that you are not limited to the homotopies provided by default.
You can define your own homotopy by defining a struct with super type [`AbstractHomotopy`](@ref).
For this the following interface has to be defined.

### Types
```@docs
AbstractHomotopy
AbstractHomotopyCache
HomotopyNullCache
```

### Mandatory
The following methods are mandatory to implement.
```@docs
cache(H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t)
evaluate!(u, F::AbstractHomotopy, args...)
jacobian!(u, H::AbstractHomotopy, args...)
dt!
Base.size(::AbstractHomotopy)
```
### Optional
The following methods provide their obvious fallback implementations.
```@docs
evaluate_and_jacobian!(u, U, H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t, c=cache(H, x, t))
evaluate_and_jacobian(H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t, c=cache(H, x, t))
jacobian_and_dt!(U, u, H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t, c=cache(H, x, t))
jacobian_and_dt(H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t, c=cache(H, x, t))
evaluate(H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t)
jacobian(H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t)
dt(H::AbstractHomotopy, x, t)
basehomotopy
```
